Description: Replacement of QtSingleApplication for Qt5
 Project SingleApplication is a replacement of QtSingleApplication
 for Qt5. It helps to keep the primary instance of your application
 and kill each subsequent instances. If enabled, it can also spawn
 secondary (non-related to the primary) instances and send data to
 the primary instance from secondary instances.
